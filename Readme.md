# Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze the Seattle Airbnb dataset to gain insights into reservation prices and the factors that influence them. By exploring the dataset and conducting statistical analysis, we provide valuable information for both guests and hosts on Airbnb.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about Airbnb listings in Seattle. It includes attributes such as listing price, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the presence of amenities like TV, Internet, and Kitchen.

## Analysis

The analysis covers three main aspects:

1. **Price Distribution**: We visualize the distribution of listing prices to understand the range and spread of prices in the dataset.

2. **Seasonal Price Variation**: We analyze the average price per month to identify any seasonal trends in pricing, helping guests and hosts make informed decisions about the timing of their reservations.

3. **Factors Influencing Reservation Prices**: We investigate the correlation between price and key attributes such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the presence of amenities. This analysis helps identify the factors that contribute to higher reservation prices.

## Findings

- The price distribution reveals the range of listing prices in Seattle, with some listings commanding higher prices.
- Prices vary based on the time of year, with higher average prices during the summer months and lower average prices in winter.
- Factors such as the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the presence of amenities (e.g., TV, Internet, Kitchen) influence reservation prices, with larger accommodations and desirable amenities correlating with higher prices.
